            Hello! My name is Ryan. I have been living in Chicago for four years now.
            I am originally from Long Island, New York. The reason I decided to move
            to Chicago was I felt the need to shake up my life. I visited my Aunt and
            Uncle every summer and fell in love with wonderful Midwest city. The reason
            I decided to get into Web Development is I wanted a career change, as well
            gaining the the valuable skills to advance me as a working professional. It's also
            the artistry and creation behind it. And the only way to tackle the pursuit of
            happiness is through creation. On my free time I enjoy playing guitar as well as
            listening to music. Other joys of mind include discovering new restuarants and bars
            around the city. I love to travel. I'm hoping to visit Copenhagen, Denmark and Bruges,
            Belgium sometime in the near future.
